choosecolor
==========

Quickly choosing colors and making palettes in R can be a chore.
The functions in `choosecolor` are a simple set of functions 
which can help to rapidly select  colors in R.  Using the "locator"
functionality in R, it enables an interactive way of selecting colors 
visually for use in R graphics. 

It's nothing fancy, just functional. I hope somebody may find it useful.

## Installation

Currently there isn't a release on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/),
and I don't think there ever will be. You can 
download the [zip ball](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/choosecolor/zipball/master) 
or [tar ball](https://github.com/MarcoDVisser/choosecolor/tarball/master).
Then decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, 
or use the **devtools** package to install the development version
(following code courtesy of [dasonk](https://github.com/Dasonk) ).

```r
## Make sure your current packages are up to date
update.packages()
## devtools is required
library(devtools)
install_github("choosecolor", "MarcoDVisser")
```

Or find the relevant functions in /src and just 
add the source code to your .Rprofile!
 
## Usage Examples

```r
# pick a color
mycol<-color.choose()

#make a pallete 
Mypalette<-palette.picker(n=5) 

# use your palette e.g.
Mypalette(10)

# Get more detail in choice with the color wheel
color.wheel()

```

The inspiration for this comes from [dsparks](https://gist.github.com/dsparks/4021110),
[menugget](http://menugget.blogspot.nl/2013/01/choosing-colors-visually-with-getcolors.html#more)
and [aviadklein](http://aviadklein.wordpress.com/2010/05/21/color-choosing-made-easy/).
However I wanted to have similar functionality as the `color_picker.R` 
version from dsparks (or the other two) but without the heavy overhead (e.g. packages), with 
more colors, and a simpler plot to pick from.
